This may take many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools on victim systems.\nAdversaries may also tamper with artifacts deployed and utilized by security tools. Security tools may make dynamic changes to system components in order to maintain visibility into specific events. For example, security products may load their own modules and/or modify those loaded by processes to facilitate data collection. Similar to Indicator Blocking, adversaries may unhook or otherwise modify these features added by tools (especially those that exist in userland or are otherwise potentially accessible to adversaries) to avoid detection. Alternatively, they may add new directories to an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool\u2019s exclusion list, enabling them to hide malicious files via File/Path Exclusions.\nAdversaries may also focus on specific applications such as Sysmon.

For example, adversaries have used tools such as GMER to find and shut down hidden processes and antivirus software on infected systems.\nAdditionally, adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain access to kernel space (i.e. Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), which may lead to bypassing anti-tampering features.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Creates guard pages, often used to prevent reverse engineering and debugging", "match_data": ["page read and write | page guard", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\file.exe\"", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\yhjYPEnbkL.exe\""]}, {"severity": "LOW", "description": "Adds a directory exclusion to Windows Defender", "match_data": ["page read and write | page guard", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\file.exe\"", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\yhjYPEnbkL.exe\""]}]}, {"id": "T1497", "name": "Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/", "description": "Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.

There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of stealth depending on the victim\u2019s network structure and defenses.", "techniques": [{"id": "T1095", "name": "Non-Application Layer Protocol", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/", "description": "Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive. Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).\nICMP communication between hosts is one example. Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host\u2019s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Performs DNS lookups", "match_data": ["DNS query: x1.c.lencr.org", "DNS query: c.pki.goog", "DNS query: www.msn.com", "DNS query: api.msn.com"]}]}, {"id": "T1071", "name": "Application Layer Protocol", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/", "description": "Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
