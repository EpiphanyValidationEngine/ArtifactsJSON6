Adversaries may use the information learned from Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.\nSpecific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such as Windows Management Instrumentation, PowerShell, System Information Discovery, and Query Registry to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or the Registry. Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks  into one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be a virtual environment. \nChecks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size. Once executed, malware may also use File and Directory Discovery to check if it was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or even analysis-related naming artifacts such as malware, sample, or hash.\nOther common checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions. In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output. \nHardware checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "reference anti-VM strings targeting Xen"}]}, {"id": "T1027.009", "name": "Embedded Payloads", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009/", "description": "Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses.

For example, adversaries have used tools such as GMER to find and shut down hidden processes and antivirus software on infected systems.\nAdditionally, adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain access to kernel space (i.e. Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), which may lead to bypassing anti-tampering features.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Creates guard pages, often used to prevent reverse engineering and debugging", "match_data": ["page read and write | page guard", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\file.exe\"", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\BujiDyqXmT.exe\""]}, {"severity": "LOW", "description": "Adds a directory exclusion to Windows Defender", "match_data": ["page read and write | page guard", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\file.exe\"", "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\BujiDyqXmT.exe\""]}]}, {"id": "T1497", "name": "Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/", "description": "Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.

Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark.
