Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon. These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.\nSince some boot or logon autostart programs run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges."}, {"id": "T1547.009", "name": "Shortcut Modification", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009/", "description": "Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.\nAdversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence. Although often used as payloads in an infection chain (e.g. Spearphishing Attachment), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also abusing Masquerading to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.\nShortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. Browser Extensions) to persistently launch malware.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Manalize Local SandBox Find Crypto"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Manalize Local SandBox Strings"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The file contains some common ransomware-related keywords."}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/04af0e3df536912a3054088bf148bdb1989a6714fef67d5e45c0dfab1bd7e6ac/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
