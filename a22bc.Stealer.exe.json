A more comprehensive list of known packers is available,  but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.\nAdversaries may use virtual machine software protection as a form of software packing to protect their code. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Manalize Local SandBox Packer Harvesting"}]}]}, {"id": "TA0009", "name": "Collection", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0009/", "description": "The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.\n\nCollection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives. Frequently, the next goal after collecting data is to either steal (exfiltrate) the data or to use the data to gain more information about the target environment. Common target sources include various drive types, browsers, audio, video, and email. Common collection methods include capturing screenshots and keyboard input.", "techniques": [{"id": "T1119", "name": "Automated Collection", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/", "description": "Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a Command and Scripting Interpreter to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. \nIn cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, data pipelines, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data. \nThis functionality could also be built into remote access tools. \nThis technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as File and Directory Discovery and Lateral Tool Transfer to identify and move files, as well as Cloud Service Dashboard and Cloud Storage Object Discovery to identify resources in cloud environments.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The process tried to detect the presence of common debug and forensic utilities"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The process attempted to detect debuggers and common forensic/analysis tools looking for known devices"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/a22bcc1320cb3cdd7165515d13d810a60a4acf850482af33c02a2f74d417205b/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
