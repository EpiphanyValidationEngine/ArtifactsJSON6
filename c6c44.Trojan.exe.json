One of the tags in these files can be apple.awt.UIElement, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\nSimilarly, on Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as PowerShell, Jscript, and Visual Basic to make windows hidden. One example of this is powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden.\nThe Windows Registry can also be edited to hide application windows from the current user. For example, by setting the WindowPosition subkey in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\%SystemRoot%_System32_WindowsPowerShell_v1.0_PowerShell.exe Registry key to a maximum value, PowerShell windows will open off screen and be hidden.\nIn addition, Windows supports the CreateDesktop() API that can create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding explorer.exe process.

The list of possible protocols is extensive. Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).\nICMP communication between hosts is one example. Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host\u2019s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Tries to download or post to a non-existing HTTP route (HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found / 503 Service Unavailable)", "match_data": ["HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:01 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:04 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:06 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:09 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:12 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:14 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlData Raw: 3c 21 44 4f 43 54 59 50 45 20 68 74 6d 6c 20 50 55 42 4c 49 ", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundDate: Tue, 13 May 2025 04:28:17 GMTServer: ApacheContent-Length: 389Connection: closeContent-Type: text/html;
