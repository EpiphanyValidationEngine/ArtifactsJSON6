Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap.  Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.\nAdversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to proxy command and control traffic.", "signatures": [{"severity": "LOW", "description": "Found Tor onion address", "match_data": [" 6\\.onion.onion.Not resolving .onion address (RFC 7686)Hostname %s was found in DNS cachelocalhostlocalhost..localhost.localhost.Bad syntax CURLOPT_RESOLVE removal entry '%s'Resolve address '%s' found"]}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/9e5a7e6baf8ccff53b554be063fa11892df5e0d909ab85bcdf19988994935025/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
