Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.\nSeveral types exist:\nBrowser-based Exploitation\nWeb browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise and Spearphishing Link. Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.\nOffice Applications\nCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing. Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.\nCommon Third-party Applications\nOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation.

Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as ftp. Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. Lateral Tool Transfer). \nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as copy, finger, certutil, and PowerShell commands such as IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString() and Invoke-WebRequest. On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such as curl, scp, sftp, tftp, rsync, finger, and wget.  A number of these tools, such as wget, curl, and scp, also exist on ESXi. After downloading a file, a threat actor may attempt to verify its integrity by checking its hash value (e.g., via certutil -hashfile).\nAdversaries may also abuse installers and package managers, such as yum or winget, to download tools to victim hosts. Adversaries have also abused file application features, such as the Windows search-ms protocol handler, to deliver malicious files to victims through remote file searches invoked by User Execution (typically after interacting with Phishing lures).\nFiles can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Downloads files from webservers via HTTP", "match_data": ["GET / HTTP/1.1Cache-Control: max-age = 3600Connection: Keep-AliveAccept: */*If-Modified-Since: Fri, 13 Dec 2024 18:01:23 GMTIf-None-Match: \"675c7673-2de\"User-Agent: Microsoft-CryptoAPI/10.0Host: x1.c.", "GET /public_files/hmmkmfh.txt HTTP/1.1Host: 62.60.226.165Connection: Keep-Alive", "GET /json.gp HTTP/1.1Host: geoplugin.netCache-Control: no-cache"]}]}, {"id": "T1095", "name": "Non-Application Layer Protocol", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/", "description": "Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive. Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).\nICMP communication between hosts is one example. Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host\u2019s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Downloads files from webservers via HTTP", "match_data": ["GET / HTTP/1.1Cache-Control: max-age = 3600Connection: Keep-AliveAccept: */*If-Modified-Since: Fri, 13 Dec 2024 18:01:23 GMTIf-None-Match: \"675c7673-2de\"User-Agent: Microsoft-CryptoAPI/10.0Host: x1.c.", "GET /public_files/hmmkmfh.txt HTTP/1.1Host: 62.60.226.165Connection: Keep-Alive", "GET /json.gp HTTP/1.1Host: geoplugin.netCache-Control: no-cache", "DNS query: ofice365.github.io", "DNS query: x1.c.lencr.org", "DNS query: geoplugin.net", "DNS query: windows.msn.com", "DNS query: assets.msn.com", "DNS query: www.msn.com"]}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Performs DNS lookups", "match_data": ["GET / HTTP/1.1Cache-Control: max-age = 3600Connection: Keep-AliveAccept: */*If-Modified-Since: Fri, 13 Dec 2024 18:01:23 GMTIf-None-Match: \"675c7673-2de\"User-Agent: Microsoft-CryptoAPI/10.0Host: x1.c.", "GET /public_files/hmmkmfh.txt HTTP/1.1Host: 62.60.226.165Connection: Keep-Alive", "GET /json.gp HTTP/1.1Host: geoplugin.netCache-Control: no-cache", "DNS query: ofice365.github.io", "DNS query: x1.c.lencr.org", "DNS query: geoplugin.net", "DNS query: windows.msn.com", "DNS query: assets.msn.com", "DNS query: www.msn.com"]}]}, {"id": "T1071", "name": "Application Layer Protocol", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/", "description": "Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
