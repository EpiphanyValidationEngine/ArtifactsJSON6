Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts. However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.\nIn ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host\u2019s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Unsuccessful connections attempts were detected (with 1 different IP:Port)"}]}]}, {"id": "TA0005", "name": "Defense Evasion", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/", "description": "The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.\n\nDefense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise.
